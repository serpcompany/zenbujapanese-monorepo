# Quality: the browser extension

A grade for the Zenbu Japanese extension for Chrome. The scale, what each column means, and when
to re-grade a row are in [`quality.md`](quality.md), with the other areas' grades.

| Area | Grade | Graded | Code | Tests | CI before merge | Docs | By hand |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Browser extension | B | 2026-10-28 | `apps/extension/` | `apps/extension/build/`: the manifest of each build, the rem conversion, and the shadow root's stylesheet as the build makes it (no rem, the `--tw-*` fallback outside any `@supports`, `:host` reset); `src/service-worker/` and `src/offscreen/`: the offscreen document opened once, and again after Chrome closes it, once it says it has started, a ping carried from a page through the service worker and the offscreen document to the worker's answer, also first after a close, or to a failure, and the relay's wait for the worker, its restart, and its time limit; `src/shared/dictionary-status.interaction.test.tsx`, in happy-dom: checking, ready, failed, and Check again; `src/content/shadow-mount.interaction.test.tsx`, in happy-dom: the test surface drawn in its own shadow root, Geist added under its own family, `.dark` on the surface, a dialog opened inside the shadow root, an error in its content handed to the content script's reporter, and all of it gone on unmount; `src/error-reports/`: page text, a page URL, and a selected word scrubbed from an event, the content script's client sending only its own errors with no global handler, and the pages' and a worker's uncaught errors sent with their part; `build/upload-source-maps.test.ts`: the upload's steps, the token only for the upload and never printed, its warnings, and the maps always taken out | `Extension`: Biome with its layer rules, typecheck, the tests, and both builds; `Repository`'s import check holds its layers | [`extension.md`](agents/extension.md), [product docs](../apps/extension/docs/product/index.md) | The unpacked test build in the agent Chrome harness, on both test pages |

- **Browser extension, B.** The code that needs no browser is tested before merge, and both builds
  must succeed, but nothing loads the built extension in Chrome before merge: the pages, the ping,
  the offscreen document's return, and the shadow root on a real page are checked by hand. Main
  gap: no check that loads the unpacked build in Chrome runs before merge; #952 brings the agent
  Chrome harness into the repository.
