# The browser extension

`apps/extension` is the Zenbu Japanese extension for Chrome, in Manifest V3. It moves into this
repository to read the shared language data (ADR 0006) and replaces the 1.1.0 prototype, whose
feature contract it follows but none of whose code it copies. Its first version runs in Chrome
only, offline, with no account: nothing signs in. It looks like zenbujapanese.com because it
draws with `@zenbu/ui` ([`ui.md`](ui.md)), and it keeps its interface text in
`src/shared/labels.ts`. What it does for a learner, and the check for each behavior, is in its
[product docs](../../apps/extension/docs/product/index.md): update them in the same PR as a
behavior change. The terms are in [`CONTEXT.md`](../../CONTEXT.md) (Browser extension, Word popup).

Run every command below from `apps/extension`, after `pnpm install` at the repository root.

## Build and load it

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm build` | The release build, in `dist/`: the manifest, the pages, the service worker, the offscreen document, the dictionary worker, and Geist. No content script yet. |
| `pnpm build:test` | The test build, in `dist-test/`: the release build plus the test content script, which runs only on `http://localhost/*` and `http://127.0.0.1/*`. |
| `pnpm test-pages` | Serves the test pages (below) on this checkout's `site` port (`node ../../tools/checks/ports.mjs`), the website's, so the two can't run at once. |
| `pnpm check` | Biome, typecheck, Vitest, and both builds. CI runs it (`Extension`, [`ci.md`](ci.md)). |

To load a build, open `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, choose Load unpacked, and pick
`dist/` or `dist-test/`. After a rebuild, press the extension's reload button there. The manifest
asks for Chrome 138 (`minimumChromeVersion` in `build/manifest.ts`), the first with the Translator
API that the extension's translations are to use (#967); on-device speech recognition (#968) is
outside the first version. The Store listing, its ID, and the version and builds that ship are
#986's.

## Code layout

| Folder | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/pages/` | The side panel, the toolbar popup, and the Settings page (the manifest's `options_ui`, opened in a tab). Each is a React page that `mountPage` (`mount-page.tsx`) starts with Geist, the theme, and `.dark` following the system setting. |
| `src/service-worker/` | The service worker. It keeps the offscreen document open (`offscreen-document.ts`) and passes a page's request on to it (`router.ts`). |
| `src/offscreen/` | The offscreen document, opened with the reason `WORKERS`. It starts the dictionary worker and relays each request to it over a `MessageChannel` of its own (`relay.ts`). |
| `src/worker/` | The dictionary worker, a dedicated module worker. For now it answers a ping (`answer.ts`); #956 gives it the dictionary. |
| `src/content/` | `mountInShadowRoot`, which draws React on a page inside a shadow root. |
| `src/shared/` | The messages and their types, the labels, Geist, the colour scheme, and the dictionary status that pages show. |
| `src/styles/` | The pages' stylesheet and the shadow root's, both Tailwind on `@zenbu/ui`'s theme, with `--font-sans` set to Geist. |
| `build/` | The Vite configuration, the manifest, and the PostCSS step that makes the shadow root's stylesheet safe on any page. |
| `test-pages/` | Two pages to mount on, the test surface, and the test content script that mounts it. |

### Messages

A page or content script calls `askDictionary(request)`, which sends `{ target: 'service-worker',
request }` with `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`. The service worker opens the offscreen document if
Chrome has closed it (it checks `chrome.runtime.getContexts`, and several requests at once share
one `createDocument`), then sends `{ target: 'offscreen', request }`. The offscreen document posts
the request to the worker with a port, and the worker answers on it. Each listener answers only
its own `target`, and every failure on the way comes back as `{ type: 'failed', reason }`, never
as a thrown error. The service worker keeps nothing between messages, since Chrome stops it when
it's idle.

### Drawing on a page

`mountInShadowRoot(content)` adds a `<zenbu-japanese>` element to the page with an open shadow
root, and draws inside it:

- **The page's styles stay out.** `:host { all: initial }` resets what the page set on the host,
  and the surface sets its own font, size, letter spacing, and colour, since a page rule that
  reaches the host element still beats `:host`. `@zenbu/ui`'s theme puts its tokens on
  `:root, :host`.
- **The page's root font size doesn't resize it.** The build turns the shadow root stylesheet's
  rem lengths into pixels, at 16px each (`build/shadow-safe-css.ts`). The pages keep rem.
- **Tailwind's `--tw-*` properties work.** Tailwind v4 registers them with `@property`, which a
  shadow root's stylesheet can't do, and guards its fallback with an `@supports` that Chrome
  fails. The build unwraps that `@supports` in the shadow root's stylesheet, so the fallback
  always applies. A page whose own Tailwind registers the same properties with `@property` is
  one of the test pages.
- **Geist is the page's font, under its own name.** A shadow root can't declare `@font-face`, so
  `addGeist` adds both subsets to `document.fonts` as `Zenbu Geist`, which a page's own Geist
  can't replace. The font files are web accessible to the pages the content script runs on.
- **Menus and dialogs open inside it.** The content goes inside `@zenbu/ui`'s `PortalContainer`,
  set to the surface, so a dialog or menu portals into the shadow root, where its styles are.
- **`.dark` follows the system setting** on the surface, never on the page.

## Test pages

`pnpm test-pages` serves `hostile.html`, whose styles fight the extension (a 10px root font size,
Comic Sans, letter spacing, uppercase, dashed borders on every element, `button { all: unset }`,
and the theme's own token names set to other values), and `tailwind.html`, built with its own
Tailwind v4, which registers the `--tw-*` properties. Load `dist-test/`, open either page, and the
test content script mounts `TestSurface`: a Card with the dictionary status, a DropdownMenu, and
a Dialog. The release build has no content script; `build/manifest.test.ts` checks that.

## Layers

- **Only the dictionary worker opens the dictionary.** Nothing outside `src/worker/` may load the
  core's `artifact/`, `search/`, `embedded/`, or `examples/` modules or SQLite, however indirectly
  (`only-the-worker-opens-the-dictionary`), or import `src/worker/` at all
  (`nothing-imports-the-worker`): the offscreen document starts the worker by its URL.
- **Pages and content scripts draw with `@zenbu/ui`,** never the Base UI or Radix primitives under
  it (`extension-draws-with-zenbu-ui`). Add what's missing to `@zenbu/ui`.
- **The service worker, the offscreen document, and the worker draw nothing:** nothing they
  import reaches React or `@zenbu/ui` (`extension-background-draws-nothing`).
- **No other app,** and shared packages by their names (`extension-never-imports-another-app`,
  `core-by-package-name`).

`pnpm verify` holds these (`apps/extension` in `verify.json`'s dependency parts), and Biome
(`apps/extension/biome.json`, `noRestrictedImports`) says the same while editing.

## Checks

- **Unit and DOM tests,** with `pnpm test`: the manifest of each build; the rem conversion and
  the `@supports` unwrapping; the shadow root's stylesheet as the build makes it, with no rem and
  the `--tw-*` fallback outside any `@supports`, and the pages' with rem kept; the offscreen
  document opened once and again after Chrome closes it; a ping from a page through the service
  worker and the offscreen document to the worker and back, and each failure; and, in happy-dom,
  `mountInShadowRoot` drawing the test surface, Geist's family, `.dark`, a dialog portalled into
  the shadow root, and unmounting.
- **In Chrome,** by hand or by an agent: load `dist-test/`, open the side panel, the popup, and
  Settings in light and dark, see "The dictionary is ready." from the side panel and the test
  surface, close the offscreen document from `chrome://extensions` (Inspect views) and check
  again, and on both test pages open the menu and the dialog, Tab through it, and close it with
  Esc and with a click outside. Until #952 moves it into the repository, agents use the agent
  Chrome harness in the main checkout's `tmp/agent/agent-chrome`. Proof goes under
  `tmp/agent/verify/`.
